                Ms. Sylvester is a proud graduate of Wayne State University.
                After graduation with her BA in Mathematics, she worked in
                corporations outside of academia where she was able to garner
                certain skills that have been useful throughout her career.
                Not too long after she returned to academia in administrative role
                and then began to pursue her graduate degree in Information Management. 
                Within the Information Management program, she is learning various skills 
                like web development and management, programming, and data management.
                She is hoping to move up the ladder and obtain a career in the Data Science
                field. In her free time, Ms. Sylvester enjoys cooking, working out, and
                spending time with family and friends.
